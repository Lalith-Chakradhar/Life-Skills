# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Question 1 - Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.

A person's success does not solely depend on their IQ, but mostly on their grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit is like stamina. Itâ€™s not about working for just one day, one week, or one month, but about working for years to make a dream a reality. Even the most talented people fail because of a lack of grit, whereas people with lower IQ but higher grit are more likely to graduate from school or college or complete any task. These people with high grit see failure as a temporary problem.


## Question 2 - Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.

There are broadly two types of mindsets - Fixed and Growth mindsets. People having fixed mindset believe skills are born and one cannot learn and grow. They cannot tolerate bad impression because of poor performance. These people think that effort is unnecessary when performing tasks, thus usually backing away from challenging ones. In contrast, there are people with growth mindset. These people believe that skills are not born but are built. One can learn and grow by putting efforts, and consider challenging tasks as valuable learning opportunity. They appreciate feedback and learn from their mistakes.


## Question 3 - What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

Internal Locus of Control says that how much work someone puts into something is something that you have complete control over. The key point of the video is that a person should not think or blame external factors that one cannot control is the reason for their success or failure. They should be responsible for their work and think that they were unsuccessful only because they did not put in enough work or appreciate themselves whenever they succeeded, it was possible only because of their efforts.
