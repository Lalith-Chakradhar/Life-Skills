## Question 1 - What is Deep Work

Deep work is the process of doing focused work without any interruptions or distractions on a single task that requires high attention. This allows you to push your abilities to their limits.


## Question 2 - According to author how to do deep work properly, in a few points?

1. Schedule your distraction periods at home and at work.
2. Develop a rhythmic deep work ritual.
3. Create a daily shutdown evening ritual. At the end of the day, note down any unfinished tasks and complete them the following day. This allows you to clear your mind and feel relaxed.
4. Sleep is the price to pay for deep work. Adequate sleep is crucial.
5. Keeping tight deadlines will help you in doing deep work. Deadlines boost productivity.


## Question 3 -  How can you implement the principles in your day to day life?

1. I implement the deep work principles when working in my office. This involves doing uninterrupted work during working hours and only being distracted during lunch breaks and after office hours.
2. I can implement the daily shutdown evening ritual by writing the unfinished tasks as an editable To-Do list on my computer.
3. I always make sure that I sleep every day for at least 7 hours, which is adequate for me.
4. I tend to overwork by setting tight deadlines for myself rather than following the official assigned deadlines, completing tasks ahead of time.
5. I avoid social media or limit my time on it in the mornings. Checking social media in the morning distracts my focus for the rest of the day.

1. Social media causes addiction. With the help of attention engineers, it is designed like a lottery machine that wastes your time and productivity while profiting from your personal data by recommending content tailored to you.
2. Social media affects your professional success. The addictive design tools on social media fragment your attention as much as possible.
3. Frequent distractions due to social media can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration.
4. The more you use social media, the more likely you will feel lonely or isolated.
5. Constant exposure to your friends' carefully curated, positive portrayals of their lives on social media can leave you feeling inadequate and increase rates of depression.
6. The infinite scroll feature on social media increases anxiety and can lead to anxiety-related disorders.
