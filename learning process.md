# Learning Process

## Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

Take a piece of paper and write the name of the concept at top. Then, explain the concept in layman's terms. Later, identify the areas that you're struggling with and go back to the sources to study the topic. Lastly, pinpoint complicated terms and challenge yourself to simplify them.

## Question 2 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Students often mistake some of their absolute best traits are their worst traits.
For example, some students can't seem to hold things in their mind very well. They compare with their classmates and think that they are dull. But surprisingly, they are more creative because they are not able to hold these ideas tightly, which allows other new ideas to slip into their minds. Some students compare themselves with others and complain they are slow in grasping things. The other students are like race cars in learning things. But the students who are slow are more like hikers. Although they are slow, they end up having completely different experiences. They do a deep and profound study of the subject and do not jump to conclusions, thus making them masters of their subject.

## Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Our brain is very complex. Still, we can simplify its operation into two fundamentally different modes. The first mode is Active mode or Focus mode. As soon as you start working on something, focus mode gets switched on. The second mode is Diffuse mode, which is a relaxed set of neural states. While learning something, we seem to go back and forth between these modes. We can take the example of a pinball game, where in focus mode, the bumpers (brain's thoughts and memories) are tighter. So, the pinball is like a new fact being launched into these tighter bumps in the focus mode. In this mode, there is limited learning, and we learn only simple things that are very comfortable for us when we use focus mode exclusively. However, when we want to learn something complicated, we should use diffuse mode. Diffuse mode gets activated when we hold that idea a repeated number of times in a relaxed state, such as taking a nap, taking a bath, or even doing some simple, regular chore. Compared to the pinball game, this mode makes the bumps looser and creates more gaps, allowing us to register the idea (movement of the pinball) in a much broader sense and even explore more complicated areas of the idea.

## Question 4 - According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

1. Deconstruct the skill: Break down the complex skill and decide what are the simpler tasks, such that you can first work on those simpler tasks of the major skill.

2. Learn enough to self-correct: Get three to five different sources like CDs, DVDs, books such that you refer to them and start practicing. You can also edit or correct yourself during the practice.

3. Remove barriers while practicing: Eliminate any sort of distractions like TV, internet or any other deviations that get in your way while practicing.

4. Practice at least for 20 hours: You will be able to overcome the initial frustration barrier by pre-committing to 20 hours of practice and practicing long enough to see results.

## Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

1. Learn things by reading as well as through a lot of practice. Practice will make me perform faster.

2. Taking good, logical breaks that will help me digest the topics.

3. Refer to two or three different sources, if I am unable to understand something. This will help me think from different perspectives and broaden my sense of learning something.

4. Revising on what I have learned. This is crucial for me and helps me remember something for a long time.

5. Explain things to my friends who do not understand the topic that I know very well, or debug my friends' code such that I can understand the topic more thoroughly and gain more experience in conveying my thoughts and views on that topic to others.
