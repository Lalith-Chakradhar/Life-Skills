# What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

1. I would ask the perpetrator/ perpetrators to stop teasing.
2. I would ask the perpetrator/ perpetrators to stop using such words or stop getting too close.
3. I would ask the perpetrator/ perpetrators to stop sending images that are too sexual for me, even though they might not seem so to them.
4. If the perpetrator/ perpetrators still does not stop, I will complain to my employer, manager, or HR.
5. If I am a repeated victim of quid pro quo harassment, I will complain to someone in a higher position than the perpetrator. If that is not possible, I will try changing my work location or company.
