# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1 - What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Focus on the speaker and the topic.
2. Try not to interrupt the other person while speaking. Let them finish and then respond.
3. Use door openers like "Tell me more", "Go ahead, I'm listening" or "That sounds interesting". This shows that you are interested and will keep the other person talking.
4. Show that you are listening with your body language.
5. If appropriate, take notes during important conversations.
6. Paraphrase what others have said, so that you are on same page.


## Question 2 - According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

1. The listener must fully engage with what the speaker is saying without interrupting with their own opinion or thoughts.
2. The listener should paraphrase or summarize the key details that the speaker is trying to convey.
3. The listener should reflect the speaker emotionally by acknowledging and validating the speaker's emotions.
4. If there is any doubt in the speaker's message, the listener should clarify their doubts to ensure the exchange of accurate information.
5. The listener should encourage the speaker to continue speaking by showing understanding, offering appropriate feedback, and using body language (like nodding or maintaining eye contact).
6. The listener should try to resonate with the speaker by imagining themselves in the speaker's shoes. This allows the the listener to understand the speaker's feelings and ensures the speaker feels respected.


## Question 3 - What are the obstacles in your listening process?

1. Interruptions from my own thoughts and getting lost in them.
2. Deviating to something more interesting in nature compared to the speech.
3. Lack of interest in listening to the speaker because it sounds cliche to me.
4. Not having the resolve to listen to the speaker because it feels unnecessary or I do not personally like the speaker's attitude.
5. Stopping listening to the speaker because it is too overwhelming to take in all at once.


## Question 4 - What can you do to improve your listening?

1. Improve focus by actively listening to the speaker and controlling my thoughts through meditation.
2. Ensure a clear purpose for why I need to listen to the speaker and understand how it is useful to me in the present moment.
3. Paraphrase what the speaker has said to ensure both parties are on the same page.
4. Ask the speaker to pause occasionally, allowing me to process the information and ask any questions.
5. Improve my verbal and non-verbal feedback to make the speaker feel engaged and interested in continuing the conversation.


## Question 5 - When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

1. When I don't want to sound aggressive but need to ignore someone because of work.
2. When I don't want to spill the beans when asked about something personal or esoteric.
3. When I know the other person isn't going to listen to me if I become aggressive or assertive (this happens usually with older people).


## Question 6 - When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

1. When someone is not listening to me, even though I tried being assertive about the topic. This usually happens when the other person needs to know the accurate information.
2. When there is a deliberate need to make someone finish their work because time is short and the task needs to be completed. This occurs when we are working on something together.
3. When someone keeps making the same mistakes despite me pointing them out.


## Question 7 - When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

1. When I'm talking with close friends, I sometimes use passive-aggressive communication, like sarcasm or taunts, resulting in funny banter.
2. When I have to speak to someone I donâ€™t really vibe with or enjoy talking to, I usually give them the silent treatment.
3. Whenever I speak with elders who aren't jovial/kind to me, I tend to give them the silent treatment.


## Question 8 - How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyze the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

1. Identify how I feel and express my feelings more clearly with words.
2. Recognizing what are my needs and expressing them.
3. Start using assertive communication gradually by applying this technique in non-important situations.
4. Understanding and improving my verbal and body language such that I can correctly tell when should I be assertive and how much assertiveness I can apply on each person such that I may not be aggressive.
5. Speak up immediately when there is an urgent problem to address.
