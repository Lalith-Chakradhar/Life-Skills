# Tiny Habits

## Question 1 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

How to trigger a new behavior/habit: If you use an existing behavior in your life and put the new tiny behavior after it, the existing behavior becomes the trigger for the new habit.


## Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

We can use B = MAP to inculcate a habit like reading a book every night before bed by setting the motivation to read, for example, "I will read at least 3 pages or I will read for 15 minutes," which matches the ability of how many pages/how much time we can actually read. And keeping the book visible as soon as you enter your room will prompt you to read.

M, A, and P stand for Motivation, Ability, and Prompt, which work together in creating and maintaining a new habit.


## Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Shine becomes crucial in turning a tiny habit into a major one. For example, converting reading 3 pages of a book to reading 3 chapters in one go. Even when the habit is small, celebrating after completing it gives us a sense of authentic pride. This is similar to getting a job after rigorous rounds of interviews or winning a game. Celebrating even after completing a tiny habit improves our confidence and motivation, increasing the frequency with which we successfully perform the habit.


## Question 4 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. The actions you take every day over the long term provide evidence of the kind of person you believe yourself to be. This is because we tend to believe something only if there is a lot of evidence to support it.


## Question 5 - What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity. When we solve problems in terms of outcomes and results, we only solve them temporarily. But in order to solve problems in the long term, we need to change our identity. For example, instead of simply avoiding junk food temporarily, focus on how you want to look or how healthy you want to be. This will automatically make you stop eating junk food.


## Question 6 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

Reduce the friction/difficulty of doing the habit and make your environment more suitable so that the habit can be easily developed. For example, whenever we feel frustrated and tempted to procrastinate the habit, we can keep things nearby that we enjoy doing instantly. Keeping a piano or guitar nearby will encourage us to play whenever we don't feel like working on that habit. This will also stop us from frequently procrastinating.


## Question 7 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

Make bad habits more difficult by making the cues invisible, the actions unattractive and hard, and the rewards unsatisfying in an ideal world.


## Question 8 - Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I used to draw and sketch a lot! However, that habit faded away due to the frequent use of social media whenever I had free time, as it provides instant gratification. Now, I want to rebuild that habit and learn how to paint as well. So, I would like to take the following steps:

1. Place the sketchbook and my art pencils in a visible location as soon as I enter my room.
2. Draw for at least 10-20 minutes a day.
3. In art, I usually get demotivated during the hard parts, so I would like to take those parts slower.
4. Once I get comfortable with sketching, I want to learn about painting through a course or YouTube tutorials.
5. Then, I will do sample drawings and paintings. I want to do as many sample drawings and paintings as possible so that my progress will make me believe that this is my real work.
6. Eventually, drawing and painting will become so easy that I can casually do artwork whenever I have free time, even if it is short.


## Question 9 - Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to eliminate the habit of using my phone or social media too frequently. The steps I am taking now and will continue taking are:

1. Putting the phone in a drawer or somewhere I don't usually access.
2. Strictly avoid using the phone in the morning by filling my mornings with daily tasks and doing them slowly, or by playing a game of basketball on the nearby court!
3. I have more than one interest, such as drawing, painting, and cooking, so whenever I have free time, I can choose one of these activities instead of using social media. Even if I don't feel like drawing, I'll cook instead.
4. Talk with family members or meet friends outside.
5. Eat something I like outside instead of ordering food online.
6. Incorporate good habits like reading a book, meditating, or working on a new skill every day.
7. Play computer games. I find playing video games is better than scrolling through social media and feeding random reels and posts into my brain.
8. Chant a mantra whenever I have free time and cannot access the gear needed for the hobbies I enjoy.
