# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1 - Which point(s) were new to you?

1. Take notes while discussing requirements with your team.
2. If the current deadline will not be met due to changes, inform the relevant team members about the new deadline.
3. Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable to private DMs simply because more people can see the main channel.
4. Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, answer the call and inform them that you will call back in 5-10 minutes, then return the call. This is a much better alternative than letting it go as a missed call.
5. Remote work is still work.
6. Make sure to do some exercise to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.


## Question 2 - Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

1. Gathering requirements – Taking enough notes to ensure I am completely clear on the requirements.
2. Over-communicating – Communicating with teammates more frequently to maintain rapport and stay updated on the latest changes and issues. This also helps in ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of the requirements and what part of the project to work on.
3. Stuck? Ask questions – Asking detailed questions with images and clear problem statements so that the other person can easily understand my issue.
